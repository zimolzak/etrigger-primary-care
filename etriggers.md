For the PSCI grant (VA Houston partnering with VA Greater Los Angeles
and VA Puget Sound), here is a list of electronic triggers previously
developed by Hardeep Singh's research group, limited to those triggers
most pertinent to the primary care setting.

# Missed test results

1.  Colon cancer (FOBT, FIT, iron deficiency anemia)
2.  Lung cancer (imaging findings)
3.  TSH
4.  HCC (alpha-fetoprotein)
5.  Bladder cancer (hematuria)
6.  Mammography
7.  PSA (Murphy et al, BMJ QS 2014)

# Re-visit

8. Re-visit (*Arch IM*. primary care visit followed by hospitalization
    or unplanned outpatient visit.)

9. Telemedicine and re-visit (currently ongoing)
