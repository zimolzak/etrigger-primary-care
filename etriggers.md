For the PSCI grant (VA Houston partnering with VA Greater Los Angeles
and VA Puget Sound), here is a list of electronic triggers previously
developed by Hardeep Singh's research group, limited to those triggers
most pertinent to the primary care setting.

# Missed test results

- Colon cancer (FOBT, FIT, iron deficiency anemia) [^cgh]
- Lung cancer (imaging findings) [^lung],[^lung2]
- TSH [^tsh]
- HCC (alpha-fetoprotein) [^cgh]
- Bladder cancer (hematuria) [^bladder]
- Mammography [^mammogram]
- PSA [^psa]

# Care Escalation

- Care escalation: Primary care visit $\to$ (hospitalization, or ER,
or urgent care, or unplanned primary care) [^escal]

- Telemedicine and re-visit/escalation (currently ongoing)
